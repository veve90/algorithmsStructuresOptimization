# Algorithms Structures Concepts
Here I'll put my notes about basic programming (algorithms, structures, optimization)




## Data Structures
* linked lists
* trees, tries, graphs
* stachs(FILO), queues(FIFO)
* heaps
* vectors
* hashTables


## Algorithms
* breath - First Search
* Depth - First Search
* binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort


## Concepts:
* Bit Manipulation
* Memory
* Recursion
* Dynamic Programming
* Big O time & Space
    * binray search: O(log N)
    * recursive functions with Multiple calls => O(branch ^ depth)
* Optimization acronymes
    * BUD: Buttlenecks, Unnecesary work, duplicated work
    * BCR: Best Conceivable Runtime != Best Case Runtime
